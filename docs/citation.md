### Abstract

> Domain generalization remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, particularly when combined with the discovery of novel categories not seen during training. We introduce HIDISC, a novel hyperbolic framework that leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry to address both domain generalization and generalized category discovery simultaneously. Our approach exploits the natural hierarchical structure of hyperbolic space to better model complex domain relationships and category taxonomies. Through comprehensive experiments on standard benchmarks including PACS, Office-Home, and DomainNet, we demonstrate that HIDISC achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 3.1% across datasets while maintaining the ability to discover novel categories with high accuracy. The effectiveness of our hyperbolic approach provides new insights into the geometric foundations of domain generalization and opens promising directions for future research.
