# HIDISC: A Hyperbolic Framework for Domain Generalization

Welcome to the official documentation for **HIDISC** (Hyperbolic Domain Generalization with Generalized Category Discovery), a novel framework accepted at **NeurIPS 2025**.

## Overview

HIDISC is a cutting-edge hyperbolic framework designed to tackle the challenging problem of domain generalization with generalized category discovery. Our approach leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry to improve generalization across different domains while discovering new categories not seen during training.

## Key Contributions

### 🌐 Hyperbolic Geometry for Domain Generalization
We introduce a novel application of hyperbolic geometry to domain generalization, taking advantage of hyperbolic space's natural hierarchical structure to better model domain relationships.

### 🔍 Generalized Category Discovery
Our framework simultaneously addresses domain shift and category discovery, enabling models to generalize to new domains while identifying previously unseen categories.

### 📊 Comprehensive Evaluation
We provide extensive experimental validation across multiple benchmark datasets:
- **PACS**: Person, Art, Cartoon, Sketch domain adaptation
- **Office-Home**: Real-world to synthetic domain transfer
- **DomainNet**: Large-scale multi-domain dataset

### 🏆 State-of-the-Art Results
HIDISC achieves superior performance compared to existing methods, demonstrating significant improvements in both domain generalization and category discovery tasks.
